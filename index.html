		C is a general-purpose high level language that was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix operating system. It was first implemented on the Digital Eqquipment Corporation PDP-11 computer in 1972.
		The Unix operating system and virtually all Unix applications are written in the C language. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons.All the C programs are writen into text files with extension ".c" for example hello.c. You can use "vi" editor to write your C program into a file.
		This tutorial assumes that you know how to edit a text file and how to write programming insturctions inside a program file.
